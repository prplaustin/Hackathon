# Hackathon

To run these tests, please install Cypress. (see here - https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html)

Load the tests to Cypress. (see here: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Add-a-test-file)

The traditionaltest.js and traditionaltestV2.js files do not use applitools. The V2 file should return errors to highlight the differences. 

The VisiualAiTests.js file will run applitools. I am not sure if you will have to link your API Key or not to get this to work.
